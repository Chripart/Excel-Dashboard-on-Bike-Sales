# Excel-Dashboard-on-Bike-Sales

Objective: Creating a Dashboard on Bike Sales using Microsoft Excel


Step 1: Cleaning the data (Worksheet)
-Removed duplicates
-Updated single-letter data entries (e.g., M/F) to more descriptive terms (e.g.,Male/Female)
-Adjusted all income values by removing decimal points
-Created a column with the age ranges (Adolescent (<31), Middle Age (>=31), Old (>54)) for a less cluttered look in the graphs


Step 2: Creating Pivot Tables (Pivot Table)
-Pivot Table 1: Table with the Gender and Income + Bike Purchase
-Pivot Table 2: Table with Commute Distance + Bike Purchase
-Pivot Table 3: Table with Age Ranges + Bike Purchase

I also created the barplot for Table 1 and the graphs for Tables 2 and 3 that I will be using in the Dashboard


Step 3: Creating the Dashboard

-Aligned my graphs from the previous step
-Added extra slicers for further filtering (Marital Status, Education, Region)

My Dashboard for Bike Sales is COMPLETE!
